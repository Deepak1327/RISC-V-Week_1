# Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis.

## Inroduction to Open-Source Simulator Iverilog

### L_1:- Intorcution to Iverilog Design Test bench.

-Simulator:- It is a tool viz used to check the Design.
-Iverilog is the tool to simulate RTL.
-Design:- It is actual verilog code which has the desired functionality.
-Test Bench:- It is set of patterns which is used/applied to test or check the design.

- How Simulator Works?
-- Simulator looks for the change on the input signals, output is evaluated only when input changes.
